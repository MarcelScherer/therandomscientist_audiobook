INSTALL:
========

1 - If you don't have Distutils installed (e.g. python version <= 1.5.2)
then first download it from :

        http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/

then follow the installation instructions for Distutils and install
it on your system.

2 - Download the latest PyMP3Cut version from :

        http://www.librelogiciel.com/software/

3 - Extract it :

        gzip -d pymp3cut-x.xx.tar.gz | tar -xf -

        where x.xx is pymp3cut's latest version number.

4 - Install it :

  Go to pymp3cut's directory:

        cd pymp3cut-x.xx

  Just type:

        python setup.py install

  You may need to be logged in with sufficient privileges (e.g. root)

  This will generally install pymp3cut and pmpcmp3 in /usr/local/bin or
  an equivalent path depending on your system, and the modules
  in /usr/local/lib/pythonX.XX/site-packages/

To learn how to use it, just launch pymp3cut with --help
as its first argument.
